                        Private vehicles are not allowed inside. You need to hire vehicles at gate which cost around rs. 1800 . As per rule 8 person are allowed in one vehicle however they don't club different groups by them self. It is subject to mutual agreement between 2 different groups. So if you are couple or family of 4 you still need to pay 1800. Just tip. Insist for open jeep vehicle for better safari experience, You may have to wait for that at gate.
                        
                        We were couple and entered in forest at around 1 pm unfortunately couldn't spot any animal however safari through forest is good. <br><br>
